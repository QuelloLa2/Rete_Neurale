Simple Neural Network for Classification

This project implements a simple neural network with a backpropagation algorithm for binary classification. It uses two weights and a bias to classify data into two classes: blue and red.
Description

The model takes two inputs, x and y, and predicts an output value that represents a class (0 or 1). The network uses the sigmoid activation function to determine the output and applies gradient descent to update the weights during training.

##The training data is divided into two classes:

    Blue (class 0)
    Red (class 1)

##Features

    Learning: The model is trained using the gradient descent loop with a learning rate of 0.9.
    Classification: The network can predict the class of new data points after training.
    Weights and Bias: The weights and bias are updated iteratively to minimize the prediction error.

##Technologies

    Python 3.x
    math and random for mathematical calculations and random number generation.
